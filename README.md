# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
---
### Introduction:
When the pandemic started in March 2020 no one had any idea that what tragedy we all are going to face in the comming months. 
We also did not have any idea that what this virus is. 
Then we all were hopless by looking around the number of cases and deaths, because there were no enough beds in the hospital, 
there was no any vaccincation available in the beginning to help us fight against the deadly virus.

### Objective:
The aim of this project is to amalyse the covid-19 data from the very beginning to till date **22-07-2022** to get some useful insights like, the number of cases, deaths by country,
continent, year, month, week in order to understand the underlying trend. We will also analyse that what was the total number of total tests conducted by each country,
how many tests center were there, and so on. I have created few of the useful metrics that will help us to understand the cases growth rate, 
death growth rate, by week and month. 

The main objective of this project is to keep us ready for any new pandemic, so that we can save millions of lives by saving the lives of the people and by saving the 
economy of the countries from collapsing.

#### Final note:
This project is still in development phase.
